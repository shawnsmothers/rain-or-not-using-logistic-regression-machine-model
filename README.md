# Rain-or-not-using-logistic-regression-machine-model
Predicted analysis using logistic regression machine model. 

## Desciption
This is part two of the project where I used a logistic regression model to train the data and achieved a 91% accuracy score. After applying feature engineering and reduction, I selected the top 10 features that had the highest relationship with the target variable (RainTomorrow). I created a new DataFrame using these features and trained the model again, resulting in a 91% accuracy score.
